# Christopher Konopka Technology Resume

# What?
I created a technology resume using React and Semantic-UI making it easier to update with new information. Served by Heroku, the application seamlessly updates the single-page React web application with each new commit. 

# Why?
It is easier for me to update a single-page application on-the-go using this workflow, and I can use this template for my artist portfolio.
